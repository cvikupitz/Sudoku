######### README #########

Welcome to Team IDK's repository for the Sudoku desktop application.

######### What is this repository for? #########

This repository is for viewing our project's source code, and also contains download links for the final project as well as a .tar archive containing the project. You can download the application and the project under 'Downloads'. 

This is the first and only version of the project.

Due to my teammates' confusion on how to use BitBucket and how files should be organized and uploaded, I as the administrator have made all the commits on this page. All java files modified and contributed by other team members have been downloaded and exchanged across our Slack page.
